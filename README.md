# React-Slider-Progress-Widgets

This project is currently showcasing two widgets using React JS.

1. Circular Progress Bar Widget With Range Slider
2. Vertical Slider Bar widget

#### Circular Progress Bar Widget With Range Slider

This widget displays a circular progress bar along with a range input slider, you can update the progress on changing
range input and also by updating the progress text displayed inside the circle.
The range input and the progress bar will always be in sync on every update.

This widget displays a set of rectangular bars cropped under an inverted triangle. On click of the bar it displays the
value and lighten up the other bars displaying the progress. This widget has some cool hover effects.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Installation

[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v14+ to run.

Clone the project or download zip file.

#### Install Dev dependencies

```sh
npm install
```

Run application using -

```sh
npm start
```

Once successfully compiled, the application will be running on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more
information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will
remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right
into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will
point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you
shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't
customize it when you are ready for it.
